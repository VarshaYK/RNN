# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

# Wht RNN

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful tools in the machine learning toolkit, but they have certain limitations when it comes to handling sequential data. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why they may not be the best fit for sequential data and what alternatives might be better suited:

1. Lack of Temporal Dependencies

   
Sequential data, such as time series or language data, has temporal dependencies where the order of data points is crucial. ANNs and CNNs, in their basic forms, do not inherently account for these temporal relationships. They treat each input independently and do not maintain information about the sequence in which data points appear.

3. Fixed Input Sizes

   
ANNs and CNNs typically require fixed-size inputs. This can be a limitation for sequential data where the length of sequences can vary. While padding or truncating sequences to a fixed length is possible, it can lead to information loss or inefficiencies.

5. Contextual Information

   
In sequential data, the meaning of a data point often depends on its context within the sequence. For example, in natural language processing, the meaning of a word can change based on the words that come before or after it. ANNs and CNNs do not inherently capture this context. While CNNs can capture some local patterns through convolutional filters, they still lack the ability to maintain long-term dependencies.
